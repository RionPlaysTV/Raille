This project is a Wordle-like web game for UK rail stations. Each day, a new station is randomly picked from a list. The player has a limited number of guesses to identify the station. Use browser cookies to restrict players to one attempt per day. Use React and Vite for a 1980s styles NSE era, clean UI.
